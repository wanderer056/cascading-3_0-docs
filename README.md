# Cascading 3.0 Documentation (Rehosted)

## What is this?
This project is a rehosted version of the **Cascading 3.0 Documentation**.  
The original site went offline, and navigating the Wayback Machine was tricky and slow ðŸ˜….  
So, I rehosted it on **cascading.sumantapaudel.com.np** to make it easy to browse â€” and now itâ€™s fully searchable!

## Why I created it
- The original docs were hard to access and search through.  
- I wanted a **fast, user-friendly version** for developers and enthusiasts.  
- Made in minimal time using **Cursor AI** â€” yes, it was a bit of a hackathon! âš¡  
- Provides **offline-friendly, searchable docs** that anyone can explore.

## Features
- Fully static HTML pages, hosted on **cascading.sumantapaudel.com.np**.  
- Search functionality powered by **Pagefind**.  
- Clean, responsive header and layout.

## Fun Fact
Built quickly with a little AI magic âœ¨ â€” because why not make documentation creation as fun as reading it?
